## Creative Exercise using SVG
- Link: https://creative-exercise-dloac22.glitch.me/
- I chose to do SVG in this exercise.
- Examples code: https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_scripting.asp
				 https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_polygon.asp
- I only changed the color of the polygon and added styles to the page, also implement a simple backend using nodeJS.
